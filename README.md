Range_parser_&_mixing_approximator: Parses GTO+ range strings to numpy arrays. Includes a simulated annealer for simplifying mixing strategies according to a specified abstraction level i.e. 6 = units of 1/6.

Simultaneous_Tensor_Games:  Symplectic Gradient Adjustment (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04926.pdf) for general-sum tensor games with simplex projection for handling constraint to probability simplex (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.1541.pdf)
